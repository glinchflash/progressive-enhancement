<h1> The story</h1>
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors
    came around to
    commiserate. They said, <q class="villager">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
        unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.
    </q> The next day the horse came back
    bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villager">Oh, isn’t
        that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q
            class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q></p>
<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
    The neighbors then said, <q class="villager">Oh dear, that’s too <em class="bad">bad</em></q>, and the farmer
    responded, <q
            class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript
    people
    into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
    <q class="villager">Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, </q> <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q>
</p>
<blockquote>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
    tell
    whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> or <em class="bad">bad</em> — because you never
    know what will be the consequence of the
    misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <em class="good">good</em> fortune.

<!--Conclusion-->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><em class="good">Good</em> and <em class="bad">bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are <em
        class="good">good</em> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <em class="good">good</em> for bananas. Let's not
    make a big deal out of it...</p>
